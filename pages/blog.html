						Technology has an impact on how people communicate, learn, and think. It contributes to society and influences how individuals interact on a daily basis. In today's world, technology plays a critical role. It has both positive and negative effects, as well as a direct impact on people's lives. It has impacted on sectors such as communication, education, health and productivity. Instead of going all the way to your loved one's house, you can just make a phone call and talk to them. During the pandemic, all the schools were closed, but they still operated online which helped students from academic loss. People can book online reservations for hospital visits, can order medications online, and can also receive their medical reports online as well. Technology also helped offices greatly during pandemic as offices changed their physical job to online job where people could work from home. Technology has had many positive aspects on people's lives in different sectors directly impacting their regular lives.

						The field of communication is one of the areas where technology has had the most impact. Instead of spending hours on telephone and writing letters, people can now easily communicate with each other via emails. Computers and the Internet have transformed the education system. We can sit in a small room and know about the whole world. People all over the world now have access to unprecedented learning opportunities because to online schooling. The healthcare industry has been greatly influenced by technological advancements. Diagnostic tools have improved, allowing doctors to detect health concerns earlier, increasing the chances of successful life-saving treatments. Vaccines have proven to be quite effective, practically eliminating chronic illnesses. Since computers' ability to solve complicated mathematical equations has allowed them to speed up nearly any operation, technology has dramatically enhanced productivity. Engineers can use computer modeling to simulate structures, vehicles, and materials to get performance data prior to prototyping.
